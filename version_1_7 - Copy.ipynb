I would like to get into data analysis because I see it as a career that would make companies want me rather than me searching alot for companies to work at. Of course depends on your experience. I also want to get into data analysis cause i am gery curious and like working on new things or new problems to solve. I get too bored when it comes to repetitive work. I just wanted to know is it too late to start this journey as I am 26. I already started my career in aviation but in my department several airlines have a position for analyst. I was not very good at maths or algebra or calculus. I have a basic understanding of python - not very good at it meaning i cant code my own thing but i can figure out ways to make a code work by copying it from open source and then making changes to it to work for me. I did start a google data analytics course for beginners. Hoping to learn alot. Plus what made me realize i like working with data is when i noticed in my old job some of the systems werent working properly and When i looked at the data i noticed a pattern where when the data is extracted from the system it is not accurate to what it should be.

      "{'ID': '12hsvkc', 'Post': 'Hey guys. I hope you all are well. I am new to data analysis. I am alright in excel and if there is something i do not know. I just google it or use chatgpt to find how to make something word. I come from a business background. I would like to get into data analysis because I see it as a career that would make companies want me rather than me searching alot for companies to work at. Of course depends on your experience. I also want to get into data analysis cause i am gery curious and like working on new things or new problems to solve. I get too bored when it comes to repetitive work. I just wanted to know is it too late to start this journey as I am 26. I already started my career in aviation but in my department several airlines have a position for analyst. I was not very good at maths or algebra or calculus. I have a basic understanding of python - not very good at it meaning i cant code my own thing but i can figure out ways to make a code work by copying it from open source and then making changes to it to work for me. I did start a google data analytics course for beginners. Hoping to learn alot. Plus what made me realize i like working with data is when i noticed in my old job some of the systems werent working properly and When i looked at the data i noticed a pattern where when the data is extracted from the system it is not accurate to what it should be. Can you guys please give me some guidance. I do know that i will have to build a portfolio but i think i can do it. Knowing myself i know how to get the answers but i am kind of doubting myself.', 'title': 'Learning Data Analysis', 'Classification': 'Relevant', 'Reason': 'The author explicitly mentions using ChatGPT to find how to make something work in Excel, which is a direct use of ChatGPT for their work.

I would like to get into data analysis because I see it as a career that would make companies want me rather than me searching alot for companies to work at. Of course depends on your experience. I also want to get into data analysis cause i am gery curious and like working on new things or new problems to solve. I get too bored when it comes to repetitive work. I just wanted to know is it too late to start this journey as I am 26. I already started my career in aviation but in my department several airlines have a position for analyst. I was not very good at maths or algebra or calculus. I have a basic understanding of python - not very good at it meaning i cant code my own thing but i can figure out ways to make a code work by copying it from open source and then making changes to it to work for me. I did start a google data analytics course for beginners. Hoping to learn alot. Plus what made me realize i like working with data is when i noticed in my old job some of the systems werent working properly and When i looked at the data i noticed a pattern where when the data is extracted from the system it is not accurate to what it should be. Can you guys please give me some guidance. I do know that i will have to build a portfolio but i think i can do it.

I also want to get into data analysis cause i am gery curious and like working on new things or new problems to solve. I get too bored when it comes to repetitive work.

I was not very good at maths or algebra or calculus. I have a basic understanding of python - not very good at it meaning i cant code my own thing but i can figure out ways to make a code work by copying it from open source and then making changes to it to work for me. I did start a google data analytics course for beginners. Hoping to learn alot. Plus what made me realize i like working with data is when i noticed in my old job some of the systems werent working properly and When i looked at the data i noticed a pattern where when the data is extracted from the system it is not accurate to what it should be.

I just google it or use chatgpt to find how to make something word. I come from a business background. I would like to get into data analysis because I see it as a career that would make companies want me rather than me searching alot for companies to work at. Of course depends on your experience. I also want to get into data analysis cause i am gery curious and like working on new things or new problems to solve. I get too bored when it comes to repetitive work. I just wanted to know is it too late to start this journey as I am 26. I already started my career in aviation but in my department several airlines have a position for analyst. I was not very good at maths or algebra or calculus. I have a basic understanding of python - not very good at it meaning i cant code my own thing but i can figure out ways to make a code work by copying it from open source and then making changes to it to work for me. I did start a google data analytics course for beginners. Hoping to learn alot. Plus what made me realize i like working with data is when i noticed in my old job some of the systems werent working properly and When i looked at the data i noticed a pattern where when the data is extracted from the system it is not accurate to what it should be. Can you guys please give me some guidance. I do know that i will have to build a portfolio but i think i can do it.

I would like to get into data analysis because I see it as a career that would make companies want me rather than me searching alot for companies to work at. Of course depends on your experience. I also want to get into data analysis cause i am gery curious and like working on new things or new problems to solve. I get too bored when it comes to repetitive work. I just wanted to know is it too late to start this journey as I am 26. I already started my career in aviation but in my department several airlines have a position for analyst. I was not very good at maths or algebra or calculus. I have a basic understanding of python - not very good at it meaning i cant code my own thing but i can figure out ways to make a code work by copying it from open source and then making changes to it to work for me. I did start a google data analytics course for beginners. Hoping to learn alot. Plus what made me realize i like working with data is when i noticed in my old job some of the systems werent working properly and When i looked at the data i noticed a pattern where when the data is extracted from the system it is not accurate to what it should be. Can you guys please give me some guidance. I do know that i will have to build a portfolio but i think i can do it.

I just google it or use chatgpt to find how to make something word. I come from a business background. I would like to get into data analysis because I see it as a career that would make companies want me rather than me searching alot for companies to work at. Of course depends on your experience. I also want to get into data analysis cause i am gery curious and like working on new things or new problems to solve. I get too bored when it comes to repetitive work. I just wanted to know is it too late to start this journey as I am 26. I already started my career in aviation but in my department several airlines have a position for analyst. I was not very good at maths or algebra or calculus. I have a basic understanding of python - not very good at it meaning i cant code my own thing but i can figure out ways to make a code work by copying it from open source and then making changes to it to work for me. I did start a google data analytics course for beginners. Hoping to learn alot. Plus what made me realize i like working with data is when i noticed in my old job some of the systems werent working properly and When i looked at the data i noticed a pattern where when the data is extracted from the system it is not accurate to what it should be. Can you guys please give me some guidance. I do know that i will have to build a portfolio but i think i can do it.

Identify the accounts involved: \\n   - Accounts Payable (Company A)\\n   - Service Revenue (or a specific revenue account related to the service provided)\\n\\n2. Create a journal entry:\\n   - Debit Service Revenue: This represents the revenue earned from providing services to Company A.\\n   - Credit Accounts Payable (Company A): This reduces the accounts payable balance to reflect the deduction of the services provided.\\n\\n3. Post the journal entry to the ledger:\\n   - Debit the Service Revenue account in the revenue section of the ledger.\\n   - Credit the Accounts Payable account in the liability section of the ledger.\\n\\n4.

Here are the two possible entries:\\n\\n1. Net Payable:\\nIf the accounts payable balance is higher than the accounts receivable balance, resulting in a net payable, the entry would be as follows:\\n\\n- Debit the accounts payable account for the net payable amount.\\n- Credit the accounts receivable account for the same net payable amount.\\n\\n2. Net Receivable:\\nIf the accounts receivable balance is higher than the accounts payable balance, resulting in a net receivable, the entry would be as follows:\\n\\n- Debit the accounts receivable account for the net receivable amount.\\n- Credit the accounts payable account for the same net receivable amount.\\n\\nBy making this single entry in the general ledger, you effectively offset the accounts payable and accounts receivable balances, reflecting the agreement between the parties.', 'title': 'Need clarification', 'Classification': 'Relevant'}\n",
