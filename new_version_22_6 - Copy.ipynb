I started the website targeting people looking for CPA help (think of all the people who ask you to do your taxes). But no one wanted that, I have literally 0 subscribers that fit that description. I noticed it was exclusively CPAs signing up. So I geared the site towards that. My takeaway is that the general population still wants their accounting/tax advice from a human. \\n\\nThe PCAOB will never allow an audit opinion to be given by a robot.

      "{'ID': '17axfyy', 'Post': 'Lately there is a thread every other day of people asking how to get their first client as a copywriter.  The general lack of understanding of most of these posts makes it quite clear that these individuals are not ready to perform at a professional level.  Consider this your Reddit based crash course to acquiring that first client.\\n\\n**Who Am I?**\\n\\nI was a military officer who grew up in abusive households.  Reading people has always been a prerequisite for my survival.  After the military I worked in tech as it was shitting the bed, decided I wanted to be a \"freelance salesperson,\" and here I am as a Direct Response Copywriter and Sales Consultant. I have found success in multiple different niches and verticals (gyms, boutique investment firms, video marketing, SaaS) so I think the principles I will lay out for you here should be pretty much universal.\\n\\n**Get Clear**\\n\\nBefore you even think about landing clients, get clear on what you offer. Instead of niching down on the \\'who,\\' focus on the \\'what.\\' Decide whether you want to be a content writer who informs or a sales writer who persuades. Then, specialize in a particular type of content. This way, you can avoid giving strategic or consultative advice at this stage and make your starter offer something simple like:\"I specialize in informative content like blogs and articles. Most of my clients either do a 4 blog post a month package, which costs x or a 8 blog post package that costs y\"OR\"I specialize in sales copy. My fee is x upfront plus y% in royalties. Do you already have a control?\"\\n\\nKeep in mind, you are not bound to this and can change it any anytime, we are just trying to keep things simple to start.\\n\\n**Start Small**\\n\\nTake your clear offer and present it to as many people as you can.  In-person, online, doesn\\'t matter. The goal here is to build your portfolio. If possible, gather results like increased views, newsletter sign-ups, or sales that can be attributed to your copy.  With your small packages it should be hard to completely disappoint a client.\\n\\n**Guarantee Your Work**\\n\\nWith your small beginner packages you should be able to guarantee your clients satisfaction, which is that you present a professionally done product in the agreed upon amount of time.\\n\\n**Track Results**\\n\\nDon\\'t just add your copy to your portfolio; include the results whenever possible. These can serve as powerful selling points for future clients - and then you can get more targeted to niches, etc.\\n\\n**D.R. Copysmith\\'s Extra Strength Prescription**\\n\\nI maintain that the best way to learn how to have a great client acquisition process is to be your own client.  Do a skills inventory and find something you are above average at doing or making, and try to sell it as your own copywriter.  In this scenario you wear both the client hat, and the copywriter hat, and it can help you learn what you\\'d need to know to write effective copy, and how to provide customer service and clear and concise communications.  It can also help you get results that only you know about, so if your copywriting or writing in general is subpar, you may want to start here as well.\\n\\nYou can sell anything from old books or DVDs to a guide you create on effective X for Y.  Ask Google, ChatGPT, or this sub when you come across any obstacles you can\\'t seem to overcome.\\n\\n**Conclusion**\\n\\nFire away with any questions, comments, or whatever.  If even 1 person is able to use this guide to land a client, I\\'m buying myself a Volcano Hybrid as a reward :)  \\n\\n\\nEDIT: Considering this a success.  Volcano Hybrid purchased.
